McKoy Creative is creating an interactive art project aimed at combating stigma around mental health using real-time GIS display projecting in public locations in Pittsburgh, PA. They envision an app that will disseminate research around mental health stigma while displaying a real-time projection of people reporting their mental disorder experience from a specific location.
